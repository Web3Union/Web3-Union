A Global Human Initiative Concept For the Web3 Foundation Platform;
What is the Human Crypto Democratic Union?
It is a decentralized global virtual union intended for humans only. It is formed by the sum total of its citizens who all agree to and accept its constitution. In comparison, centralized non-virtual world nations like the U.S.A. have fixed land boundaries and are formed by their declaratory constitutions, parliamentary systems, rules and bylaws. A virtual union’s borrowing power and credit is solely dependent on the credibility and sum total of its citizens, whereas a non-virtual union’s borrowing power is primarily based on all the natural resources under its control.
What Advantage Does A Virtual Union Have Over Non-Virtual World Nations?
Centralized non-virtual nations depend on central banks that control the interest rates of their fiat currencies. In comparison, our decentralized union depends on cryptocurrencies which have no mechanism of control. Central banks don't recognize crypto-currencies, or when recognized they are deemed illegal. Our union not only recognizes crypto-currencies, its primary mission is to insure that our citizens may possess them worry-free.
Why Doesn't the Union Have a Human President?
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Presidents, Royalty, and Supreme Leaders are expected to continue leading non-virtual nations. But the internet permits decentralized artificial leadership to exist, such as an artificial neural network to mimic governmental executive functions. The Union will ignore innate national non-virtual issues such as infrastructureand the military, but will speak out on net neutrality and the environment.
Why Doesn't the Union Have Human Judges?
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. The belief that judges have no bias against the cases they control is fallacy. Judges enjoy absolute immunityand treat attorneys with qualified immunity. Lay persons have no immunity. Thus, all else being equal, human judges behave like water and seek their own level with attorneys first and lay persons last, if ever. In all candor, if you were a judge would you apply yourself in case after case despite the required laborious attention to details, only to assure accurate judgments, and if no matter your judgment, your job and salary would remain the same? The Union’s mission is to design artificial intelligence to convert conventional judicial common law functions into electronic statutory laws, verifiable in real time on the internet and made human user friendly.
